# I had a great experience in doing these tasks which made me explore many new things which I didn't know.I learnt many new skills for these tasks.

# I didn't find any issue with task0 and task1. I did it quite easily.

# As I am a beginner I started with task10.Here the cs50 Lectures helped me so much.

# In task3 and task5 learning through google helped me.But I found them little time taking as I am not familiar with C programming.I learnt some basics for task5.

# Learning Linux commands and usung them is one of the most interesting part in task-2.

# I am so happy and glad that i could learn how to create my personal website myself.I found task9 very interesting.

# Above all i should mention that Google is always my best friend which never disappointed me in learning new things.
